## Get the extension

- **[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/key-jump-keyboard-navigat/afdjhbmagopjlalgcjfclkgobaafamck)**
- **[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/key-jump-keyboard-navigation/)**

## How to use

Press `,` (comma) on your keyboard to show hints for all links, buttons, text fields and other things you can click or focus.

Press `.` (period) instead to open links in new tabs when they are clicked.

Press `Enter` to trigger the hint for the number you've typed. For example when there are 10 links on the page you should press `1` > `Enter` to trigger the first hint.

The hint will be automatically triggered when the number you've typed can't match any other hints. You can disable this in the extension options so you'll aways have to use `Enter` to trigger them.

Press `Escape` to hide the hints.

Some of these shortcuts can be changed in the extension options.
